Ok so here's what I need from you. Use Tony Muzo as the name, Tony@tonymuzo.dev as the email and 4379628228 as the number. Take my original resume and ignore the information that talks about all of the duties i had in the job. Instead use my job title and figure out how someone with that job title would have the experience in the things that are wanted in the job description. That way you can show how the previous experience meets what they want in the job description but stay within the confines of what someone in that position that I was in would typically do. Basically I want to show them i can do the job they want without outright lying about what I've done.  You can take more liberties when talking about the Incident response role at Cisco because I would’ve worked with different clients there so you can talk about participating in the stuff thats in the job description as a team member but do not specify that I used specific tools in that role or in any SOC analyst role. Adapt the words in the job description so that you do not outright lie about tool experience but you make it seem as though it would be easy for me to learn that tool. So for example if the job description mentions Splunk then don’t say I used splunk but imply that I would be able to use it. For the city of St. John’s our firewalls are cisco ftd’s and we use the fmc to manage it all from Cisco. Our EDR is Secure Endpoint. Our SIEM is Wazuh at the city of St. John’s and we use a hybrid set up of on-prem Active Directory but we have a Microsoft 365 Firewall. Our WAF is Barracuda. List my address as being in Toronto at 629 King Street West, M5V 0G9. Also include all the certfications I have in the final resume in the same way I have them in this resume. Also create the resume so I can copy and paste it in one go.
