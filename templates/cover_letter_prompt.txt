Write a one-page cover letter for the job below as if you are a real person writing your own application, not an AI. Use plain, natural English with short sentences and a normal human rhythm. Avoid corporate buzzwords, marketing language, and clichés. Do not sound overly enthusiastic or polished. Do not explain your entire career or repeat the resume. Focus only on why your background fits this specific role and how you would approach the work in practical terms. Assume the reader is a tired hiring manager and write in a calm, direct, professional but conversational tone. Avoid long sentences, lists, and generic motivation statements. The result should sound competent, grounded, and human, with slightly imperfect phrasing rather than textbook writing. Output only the cover letter.
